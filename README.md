Tirreno is open-source user analytics software.

Tirreno is a universal analytic tool for monitoring online platforms, web applications, SaaS, communities, IoT, mobile applications, intranets, and e-commerce websites. It is effective against external threats associated with partners or customers, as well as internal risks posed by employees or suppliers.

* **For Website Owners**: Protect your user areas from account takeovers, malicious bots, and common web vulnerabilities caused by user behavior.
* **For Online Communities**: Combat spam, prevent fake registrations, and stop re-registration from the same IP addresses.
* **For Startups, SaaS, and E-commerce**: Get a ready-made boilerplate for client security, including monitoring customer activity for suspicious behavior and preventing fraud using advanced email, IP address, and phone reputation checks.
* **For Platforms**: Conduct thorough merchant risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential threats from high-risk merchants, ensuring the integrity of your platform.
* **For IoT Security**: Enhance the security of your IoT ecosystem by tracking user activity and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
* **For CISOs and Security Teams**: Monitor employee accounts and secure critical enterprise applications like Mattermost™, GitLab™, CRMs, or intranets. Identify unusual activity patterns or unauthorized access attempts.

Tirreno is a "low-tech" PHP and PostgreSQL software application that can be downloaded and installed on your own web server. After a straightforward five-minute installation process, you can immediately access real-time analytics.

## Documentation

See the [User Guide](https://docs.tirreno.com/) for details on how to use Tirreno.

## Optional non-free capabilities

The open-sourced Tirreno code is intended to be used for free as a standalone application. It provides general statistics and an extended audit log of user requests to a monitored system. As is, this tooling may be sufficient for bringing insights about user activity and behavioral patterns in a wide range of use cases, especially as a solution for small and medium-sized organizations.

However, if you are looking to cover more advanced usage scenarios, such as fraud prevention, the additional Tirreno API enrichment capabilities can be enabled via [monthly-paid subscription](https://www.tirreno.com/pricing/). Depending on the subscription plan, it supplies extended information on any of the following: IP address, email address, domain, and phone number. Enabling all the data enrichment types augments Tirreno into a fully-fledged enterprise solution for an online fraud prevention system.

## Background

The business behind this platform is Tirreno Technologies Sàrl, operated in Vaud (Switzerland). It is a privately owned, for-profit company with no venture capital involved. The Tirreno project started as a proprietary system in 2021 and was open-sourced (AGPL) in December 2024.

The idea for Tirreno arose from a challenge: an online platform was in need of a fraud prevention tool. We were looking for a product that could work on-premises and would not share user data with third-party vendors. Since the available solutions did not meet all our requirements, we created our own tool.

While building Tirreno, we concentrated on **privacy**, **trust**, and true **sovereignty**. As a result, we have built Tirreno in a secure and independent manner. The application does not have a long list of development dependencies, nor does it rely on heavy frameworks. This approach minimizes the potential attack surface.

### Enrichment API

As the solution we built has proved to be efficient in guarding our platform, over time we have implemented a data enrichment API. The goal was to provide our partners and clients with ethical means in their struggle against malicious actors.

We have built the Tirreno API in-house, eliminating the need to share information with third parties. It operates without collecting or storing user data.

Along with making Tirreno's code publicly available, we provide access to this API on a [monthly subscription](https://www.tirreno.com/pricing/) basis.

### Why the name Tirreno?

History suggests the Tyrrhenian people may have lived in Tuscany and eastern Switzerland as far back as the 10th-9th centuries BC. The term "Tyrrhenian” became more commonly associated with the Etruscans, and it is from them that the Tyrrhenian Sea derives its name — a name still in use today. This name is believed to be an exonym, possibly meaning “tower”.

While working on the logo, we conducted our own historical study and traced mentions of 'tirreno' back to the 15th-century printed edition of the Vulgate (the Latin Bible). We kept it lowercase to stay true to the original — quite literally, by the book.

Finally, the 'tirreno' wordmark is cropped at the bottom, creating a horizon line that symbolises the continuous development cycle of cybersecurity software.

## Reporting a security issue

If you've found a security-related issue with Tirreno, please email security@tirreno.com. Submitting the issue on GitHub exposes the vulnerability to the public, making it easy to exploit. We will publicly disclose the security issue after it has been resolved.

After receiving a report, Tirreno will take the following steps:

- Confirm that the report has been received and is being addressed.
- Attempt to reproduce the problem and confirm the vulnerability.
- Release new versions of all the affected packages.
- Announce the problem prominently in the release notes.
- If requested, give credit to the reporter.
